I am a graduate student in machine learning at Stevens Institute of Technology, with a strong background in mathematics and a passion for applying technology to solve real-world problems. I am looking for full time opportunities starting January 2024.
My area of interest includes convolutional neural networks, text mining , large language models, and full stack development.I have worked as a deep learning intern at Micron Technology, where I worked on improving the electronic design automation process using graph neural networks. I built and optimized deep learning models using PyTorch framework and deployed them on multi-GPU clusters on AWS. 

Previously, I was an associate software engineer at BYJU'S, an ed-tech company, where I developed web-based applications using ReactJS and NodeJS for warehouse management. I also collaborated with the software development team of Accuknox, a cloud security platform, where I built microservices in Go and PostgreSQL. 
My work on autonomous vehicles has been published in IEEE and cited by other researchers.
